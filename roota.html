              <p>Roota users need access to online plant experts and local plant shops to purchase, maintain, and provide a healthy environment for their plants to thrive. We will know this to be true when users can effectively reach out to experts and their local shops to purchase and get advice on ways to nourish their plants.<p>

            Research Goals
          </h3>

          <ul>
            <li>I would need to know how much time people would like to dedicate to maintaining plants and does this dictate which plants to buy.</li>
            <li>I need to know if there is an interest in buying new plants or are users comfortable with the amount they have.</li>
            <li>I need to know if there is an advantage to meeting with experts in person or do they prefer online support.</li>
            <li>I need to know what motivates users to purchase plants and why they are willing to put in the work to give them a thriving environment.</li>
            <li>I need to know if users have any interest in using their skills to volunteer.</li>
          </ul>

            Results
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Interviews were 20-30 minutes long and were completed via Facetime</li>
            <li>I found that all users were motivated to give their plants a thriving environment because they valued the aesthetic and atmosphere of having plants. Their energy levels and happiness increased with plants around.</li>
            <li>I learned about the skill level of each user. Some were very experienced with plant maintenance while others could barely keep one plant alive.</li>
            <li>I found that the time it took to maintain a plant per week really dictated which plants they bought. Even if users had more time to give, they preferred plants with low maintenance or plants that could line up on the same watering schedule.</li>
            <li>While users wouldnâ€™t mind taking in person classes, they really liked the idea of getting online advice from experts. With the pandemic many people have become accustomed to a lot of their daily interactions being online if it is possible.</li>
            <li>All interviewees were interested in volunteering at a garden</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            Goals
          </h3>
          <p>The goal of this study is to test the usability of Rootaâ€™s core functions and to identify potential navigation problems. With participant feedback I hope to learn any design improvements the prototype might need.<p>

          <h3>
            Testing Objectives
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Measure how quickly users navigate through Onboarding and Sign Up/Login</li>
            <li>Observe how users interact with the introduction video</li>
            <li>Test how long it takes for users to complete a new task</li>
            <li>Identify any difficulties in the initial onboarding and daily tasks the user comes across</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            Methodology
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>This test will consist of Moderated Remote Testing.</li>
            <li>Participants will be given a video introduction that will provide a general overview of Roota and the purpose of their participation in the usability test.</li>
            <li>I will guide everyone through each task and will finish with a final debrief.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            Participants
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The test plan will consist of 6 participants within my personal network of family and friends.</li>
            <li>The core features will be assessed during this test, so the need for participants who are interested in plant care is not necessary at this point.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for the functionality of the features throughout the app.</li>

                <p>Roota is a plant care app, so naturally green was a main color to reference throughout the design. With the use of different shades of green as well as a coral pop of color, Roota came to life. The Design System and Style Guide further explain the stylistic decisions in detail.<p>
